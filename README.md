# movie_trailer
-A simple movie trailer Project for Udacity's fullstack nano degree program.
It simply explains about the movie object class
in python to display a static web page.
By using this website we can view our movie trailers
and play the videos within that window.
-In this folder we create three python files
(entertainment_center.py, fresh_tomatoes.py, media.py)
-Movie class in present in media.py module which
creates data structure to store our favourite movies,
which includes movie name, movie poster url, movie trailer video url.
-In entertainment_center.py module we import media,
fresh_tomatoes which are not inbuilt libraries and
also we create multiple instances of the Movie class,
we store them in the form of lists.
-In python module fresh_tomatoes.py we import os, webbrowser,
re and it contains open_movies_page method which contains one
argument to be passed
(ie, list that we have already created in entertainment_center.py)
this method  creates a new html page(ie, fresh_tomatoes.html).
Running the program:
    -save the three python modules
    -Then run the entertainment_center.py then it creates the html
    page named fresh_tomatoes.html and which is opened in the browser directly.
    -python entertainment_center.py
